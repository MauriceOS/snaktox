## 🐍 Project Overview

SnaKTox is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform dedicated to snakebite awareness, prevention, and emergency response. Built with verified medical data from WHO, CDC, and KEMRI, it bridges the gap between field responders, hospitals, and the public through a unified, secure system.

### Mission
To save lives by combining verified medical data, artificial intelligence, and community education to reduce snakebite mortality and disability in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Key Features
- 🏥 **Hospital Network**: Verified treatment centers with real-time antivenom availability
- 🚨 **Emergency SOS**: GPS-based emergency reporting with nearest hospital routing
- 🤖 **AI Detection**: Snake species recognition and first-aid chatbot
- 📚 **Education Portal**: WHO/CDC-verified awareness and prevention content
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Data-driven insights for policymakers and researchers

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI
- **Backend**: NestJS + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- **AI Service**: Python FastAPI + Machine Learning models
